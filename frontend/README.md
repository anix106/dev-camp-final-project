    - If you did version control, your README.md is a great spot for this
- App Url
- GitHub Url
- Passwords and Usernames needed to test the application
- Let us know what you included for your new language/feature/framework
- Any extra data to help assist us in grading your application

Your assignment will not be returned to you so keep a copy for your files.

It will take approximately 2 â€“ 3 business days to review your code and make sure you have a functioning Application.
